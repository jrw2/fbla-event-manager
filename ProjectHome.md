The purpose of this project is to create an event registration system. This system will be web based

and allow the designated instructor from each participating high school to register their students for

the various events. The intended use of the system is for the FBLA Northern Regional Competition

sponsored each year by Weber State University for freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior high school

students.

The project will be written using various web technologies. The primary technologies are Java Beans, MySQL and JSP.

The system will be deployed using the Apache web server and the appropriate packages
